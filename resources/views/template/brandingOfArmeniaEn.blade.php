            <br><br>
            <p class="read-more-wrap">
                Armenia is famous for its talented people both in Armenia and in the Diaspora who have an important role for the country's development and recognition. The Armenian diaspora stretches across the globe. Armenia is the ancestral homeland of <i>Cher, Andre Agassi, Serj Tankian</i> (the lead vocalist of System of a Down), <i>Atom Egoyan, Tamar Kaprelian, Ara Abrahamyan, Kardashians</i>, as well as <i>Charles Aznavour, Kirk Kerkorian</i> and many others.<br><br>
                <strong>Charles Aznavour</strong> is a French, later naturalized Armenian, singer, songwriter, actor, public activist and diplomat. Since the 1988 Armenian earthquake, Aznavour has been helping the country through his charity, Aznavour for Armenia. In 2004 Aznavour received the title of National Hero of Armenia, Armenia's highest award.<br><br>
                <strong>Kirk Kerkorian</strong> was an Armenian-American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. Kerkorian provided over $1 billion for charity in Armenia through his Lincy Foundation, which was established in 1989 and particularly focused on helping to rebuild northern Armenia after the 1988 earthquake. He was bestowed the title of National Hero of Armenia, the highest state award, in May 2004.<br><br>
                Besides these significant people in the whole world, Armenia is also known for the following things:<br><br>
               <strong> Armenia is well known throughout the region for its <i class="word-type">brandy</i>.</strong><br><br>
                Churchill had a taste for Armenian cognac too. During the Second World War, Joseph Stalin shipped several dozen cases of Armenian cognac to Winston Churchill, which the then-British prime minister consumed with gusto. His love for brandy was no secret: by his own estimate he had drunk enough brandy to fill three railway carriages by the time he was 71. One of Churchill's aides at Yalta famously wrote about the then-British prime minister “drinking buckets of Caucasian champagne which would undermine the health of any ordinary man”.<br><br>
              <strong>Armenia is one of the oldest <i class="word-type">wine</i>  producing country in the world.</strong>  <br><br>
                It’s attributed to its blessed location of being on the fertile valleys of Mount Ararat where high quality grapes of some 40 kinds could be grown and mainly on the Ararat valley. So it is the home to the world's oldest winery. At least that’s what the archaeologists claim: in 2011 they discovered what is thought to be the oldest winery on the planet, found, of all places, in a cave near the village of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areni" target="_blank">Areni.</a><br><br>
               <strong> The traditional flatbread of Armenia, called <i class="word-type">lavash</i>, is UNESCO-listed.</strong><br><br>
                Dinner tables are rarely without huge piles of lavash, a tasty flat bread that is the cornerstone of Armenian cuisine. Armenians bake their lavash in a tonir which basically refers to an underground earth oven. Armenians love to eat lavash which is this thin layer of flat chewy bread that’s made from flour, salt and water. Lavash can be kept for 1 year without turning bad. So usually the local women will bake the lavash in bulk and then store them to eat slowly for the next few months. So important is this humble dish, that it was placed on UNESCO’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2014.<br><br>
               <strong> The <i class="word-type">pomegranate</i>  is one of the most recognizable symbols of Armenia.</strong><br><br>
                In Armenian mythology it symbolizes fertility and good fortune. At weddings in Western Armenia, a bride would throw a pomegranate and break it into pieces. Its scattered seeds ensured that the bride would bear children.<br><br>
                Pomegranate is a commonly used theme in Armenian art and culture including cuisine. In fact, it has turned into a national cliché. Go to any art exhibition, and you’re sure to see two or three (or more) paintings where the pomegranate is featured. Souvenir shops are filled with ceramic, metal, and textile pomegranates.<br><br>
                Many Armenian artists have used pomegranates as a theme in their lyrics and poems to describe a wide range of emotions, from suffering to hope, rebirth and survival of a nation.<br><br>
                <strong>The <i class="word-type">apricot</i>  is one of the symbols of Armenia</strong><br><br>
                Apricot grows in Armenia from immemorial times. It has an incomparable taste and is considered to be the queen of Armenian fruits. The famous golden Armenian apricot absorbs the bright rays of Armenian sun every year and is guaranteed to please due to its gentle taste and aroma. When you walk through the markets, you’ll find vendors selling apricots of all sorts, as well as fresh apricots, dried apricots, apricots flavored wine, apricot juice, apricot chocolates, jams and anything else that you can think of!<br><br>
                <strong>Armenia has a record-breaking <i class="word-type">cable car</i>.</strong><br><br>
                According to Guinness World Records, the longest non-stop double track cable car is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Tatev"  target="_blank">Wings of Tatev</a> Aerial Tramway, which clocks in at 5752 m (18.871ft) long. The spectacular cable car connects the village of Halidzor with the Tatev Monastery, offering unique views across the Vorotan River Gorge.
