                <strong>Present day Armenia</strong><br><br>
                Armenia, officially the Republic of Armenia, is a mountainous country in the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasia" target="_blank">South Caucasus</a> region
                of Eurasia between
                the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Located in West Asia on the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Highlands" target="_blank">Armenian Highlands</a>, it is
                bordered
                by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Republic of
                Artsakh and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the
                south.<br><br>
                Armenia is a unitary, multiparty, democratic nation-state and one of the oldest and most historic
                civilizations in the world with a rich cultural heritage, as well as the first nation to adopt
                Christianity as its official religion. Although Armenia is constitutionally a secular state, the
                Christian faith plays a major role in both its history and the identification of the Armenian
                people.<br><br>
                Culturally, historically, and politically, Armenia is considered to be part of Europe. However, its
                location in the southern Caucasus means that it can also be considered to be at the arbitrary border
                between Europe and Asia: in other words, a transcontinental nation.<br><br>
                Armenia is currently a member of more than 35 different international organizations including the United
                Nations, the Council of Europe, Asian Development Bank, the Commonwealth of Independent States, World
                Trade Organization and Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. It is a Partnership for Peace
                (PfP) member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and in a military alliance of CSTO. It is also an
                observer member of the Eurasian Economic Community, La Francophonie, and the Non-Aligned Movement.
                Armenia is also active in the international sports community with full membership in the Union of
                European Football Associations and International Ice Hockey Federation.

                The Armenian civilization had its beginnings nearly 3000 years ago. Armenia lies in the highlands
                surrounding the Biblical mountains of 
                <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat" target="_blank">Ararat</a>. The original
                Armenian
                name for
                the country was 
                <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Origin_Of_Armenians" target="_blank">Hayk</a>, later Hayastan,
                translated
                as the land of Hayk. The legendary forefather of Armenians, Hayk, famous for his battles with Babylonian
                ruler Bel, most likely was one of the tribal leaders.<br><br>
                The name Armenia was given to the country by the surrounding states, and it is traditionally derived
                from Armenak or 
                <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Hurrians" target="_blank">Aram</a> (the great-grandson of
                Hayk's
                great-grandson, and another leader who is, according to Armenian tradition, the ancestor of all
                Armenians).
                Generally, historical Armenia is famous for its eminent kingdoms, which are:<br><br>

            <strong>Tigranes II</strong>, more commonly known as <strong>Tigranes the Great</strong> (140 – 55 BC) was
            King of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)" target="_blank">Armenia</a> under
            whom the
            country became, for a short time, the strongest state to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic" target="_blank">Rome</a>'s east. He was a member
            of the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxiad_dynasty" target="_blank">Artaxiad Royal House</a>.
            Under his reign, the Armenian kingdom expanded beyond its traditional boundaries, allowing
            Tigranes to claim the title "Great King", and involving Armenia in many battles against opponents such
            as the Parthian and Seleucid empires, and the Roman Republic.<br><br>
            At its height, his empire extended from the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic_Mountains" target="_blank">Pontic Alps</a> (in modern
            north-eastern
            Turkey) to 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia" target="_blank">Mesopotamia</a>,
            and from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea" target="_blank">Caspian Sea</a> to the
            Mediterranean. A series of victories led him to assume the Achaemenid
            title of "King of Kings", which even the Parthian kings did not assume, appearing on coins struck after
            85 BC. Hence, the phrase "sea to sea Armenia" is a popular expression used by Armenians to refer to the
            kingdom of Tigranes, which extended from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.<br><br>
            Over the course of his conquests, Tigranes founded four cities that bore his name, including the capital
            of Tigranocerta.
